# Ardino
These are all the essential programs for all beginners and amateurs in Arduino. Some of these examples include closed-loop motor control, timer counter and dual motor control all based on the Atmel 328 chip. In order to better understand the code I recommend reading the documentation of the Atmel 328p chip ( https://semiconductors.es/semiconductors.php?id=1469778 ) the Arduino Uno R3 docs ( https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/datasheets/A000066-datasheet.pdf )
The motor used for the timer and PWM program is a Maxon servo motor F-2260 80w 27:1 gearbox digital encoder HPES-6540 (1000ppr 3-channels) [ you might have to edit your pulse and timer values based on the motors available to you. 
The motor used for the RCWS is an oriental motor PK296B2-SG18 Stepper motor in half-step mode.
